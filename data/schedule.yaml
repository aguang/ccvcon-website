    abstract: "We have developed Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations based on guineafowl X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) data and CT scans of Early Jurassic fossil dinosaur tracks. Foot motion data serve as inputs for dynamic DEM substrate simulations made up of millions of particles. To explore the dense volumes of 3D data generated from these methods, we turned to an immersive virtual reality (VR) room, Brownâ€™s Yurt Ultimate Reality Theater (YURT). This talk will highlight the process of developing interactive visualizations that allow us to synthesize substrate flow at the particle, particle cluster, surface, and volumetric scale. "

    abstract: "Phthalate esters (phthalates) are a class of compounds used to plasticize polyvinyl chloride and as components of various industrial and personal care products. Human exposure to phthalates is nearly universal, and phthalates are known male reproductive toxicants, which creates a concern for human health. Testicular toxicity of phthalates is complex, involving both anti-androgenic effects and impairment of testis morphogenesis. Effects on testis morphogenesis are more difficult and time-consuming to quantify than anti-androgenic effects, and as a result are not factored into risk assessment for phthalates. To address this problem, we sought to develop a method for automatic identification of multinucleated germ cells (MNGs), a marker of phthalate toxicity, in digital images of fetal rat histological sections."

    abstract: "Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have provided compelling genetic associations for human complex traits and diseases, contributing to therapeutic target discovery and disease risk prediction. Unfortunately, associations discovered by current GWA methods only explain a modest proportion of the estimated heritability of these traits. Non-linear genetic effects have been proposed as a key contributor to this missing heritability problem."

    abstract: "Natural Language Processing (NLP) concerns the interactions between computers and human languages. Natural languages contain huge amounts of information, from the topics we talk/write about and our tone to the words we choose and their context. Because of their complexity, volume, and unstructured format, text data are messy and tricky to manipulate. This Python tutorial walks through basic steps in text processing. We will work with a sample corpus of documents and prepare it for downstream NLP tasks such as document classification and topic modeling. Topics covered include: text cleaning and normalization, stemming and lemmatization, bag of words, and n-grams."
